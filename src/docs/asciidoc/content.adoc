== Multi-repo vs Monorepo

Gradle has tended to support 2 main patterns for software composition

== Multi-repo

* Multiple software components kept in separate VCS repositories
* Each component built and published separately
* Integration of components is done via binary dependencies.

=== Multi-repo (Example)

== Monorepo

* Multiple software components kept in a single VCS repository
* Typically, the build is configured as one multi-project build
* Integration of components via project dependencies.

== Jargon

* Build
* Projects
* Composites
* Participants

== Conclusion...

* TBD

=== But...

* Dependency substitution is limited 
   - Only works with Java projects
   - Only works when all participants have the same version of Gradle
* Composite builds require special tooling to use TBD
